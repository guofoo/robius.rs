*Author: [Kevin Boos](https://github.com/kevinaboos). Published December 28th, 2024.*

This past year marked the first year of work on **Project Robius**: an open-source decentralized endeavor to enable developers to write immersive, fully-featured apps in pure Rust that work seamlessly across all major platforms.

> ðŸ›ˆ Project Robius in a nutshell
>
> While GUIs are the foundation of an app, there is more to developing a modern featureful app than just drawing a UI.
> Project Robius aims to fill in the gaps in the Rust app dev ecosystem by focusing on everything *except*  the UI, such as abstractions for platform features & OS services, build & packaging tooling, and more.
> We leave UI work to the experts behind the many excellent Rust UI toolkits under active development.

In this post, we'll take a look back on what we've accomplished so far to make the world of Rust App Dev a little better:
1. The crate abstractions we've published for accessing platform-provided features from Rust code
2. The major apps we've built using [Makepad] + Robius together
3. The contributions we've made to existing open-source projects in the App Dev space
4. The connections we've fostered throughout the Rust community

We'll also take a deeper look at **Robrix**,  a multi-platform [Matrix](https://matrix.org/) chat client written from scratch in Rust using the [Makepad UI toolkit] and Robius components.

## 1. Robius crates for platform feature abstractions

As our primary objective, we have published several crates intended to be used directly by app devs to access a given platform feature or OS service from their app. The main goal here is for each crate to offer a safe, platform-agnostic abstraction, such that the app dev need not worry about writing any platform-specific code or dealing with each platforms' idiosyncracies.

We began working on these crates in late Spring of 2024.
While development started out gradually, we are significantly ramping up our efforts for the coming year and expect to publish more frequently. That being said, here is the current list:

* [`robius-location`]: access the current geolocation of the user's device
* [`robius-authentication`]: display a native biometric or password authentication prompt
* [`robius-open`]: open a URI or file in a different app (determined by the system)
* [`robius-directories`]: access platform-standard directory locations for app data, user data, config, cache, etc
    * a fork of the [`directories`] crate that adds support for Android
* [`robius-url-handler`]: register your Rust app as the default handler for a URL scheme or file association
* [`robius-keychain`]: store and retrieve secure data/passwords from the platform's secure storage facility
    * This crate was written from scratch, but we discovered [`keyring-rs`] shortly after finishing it. We intend to contribute our additional features, mostly Android support, into `keyring-rs`.
* [`robius-dialog`]: (WIP) display a native dialog for showing a message or allowing the user to pick a file, directory, image, etc.
    * This offers a custom implementation for iOS and Android, but uses [`rfd`] under the hood for Desktop platforms.

We've also released some "lower-level" crates that aren't intended for direct use by an app developer, but they'd be useful for other developers that want to create their own platform abstractions.
The above crates depend on these in various ways.
* [`android-build`]: enables a Rust crate to automatically build Java code for Android targets, as part of a cargo build process via a `build.rs` build script.
    * The Java classfile(s) can then be used by your Rust app, typically via one of the above platform feature abstraction crates.
* [`robius-android-env`]: abstracts access to Android states owned by various UI toolkits.
    * Many Android platform features require passing in the current activity or accessing the JavaVM or JNI environment state.
    * This crate enables us to write other Rust crates that access Android platform features, such that they work seamlessly across many different UI toolkits.
    * Directly supports [`ndk-context`], an existing crate which is compatible with many other UI toolkit components, e.g., [Winit]
        * This enables all of the above platform feature abstraction crates (plus any crate that depends on `robius-android-env`) to work with Winit-based apps on Android.
    * Compared to `ndk-context`, the `robius-android-env` crate offers a "batteries-included" experience that automatically "just works" with supported UI toolkits, such that the app dev doesn't have to add any code to make things work.

## 2. Apps built in 2024 using Makepad + Robius

We (with help from many collaborators) have built both small proof-of-concept demo apps and larger "flagship" apps using Makepad + Robius. Two of the most complex flagship apps we've been developing in 2024 are:
* [Robrix]: a Matrix chat client for power users
* [Moly]: a local LLM chat runtime and AI agent explorer (previously "Moxin")

Both of these apps are fully open-source and have releases available on GitHub, in case you'd like to download and try them out. (However, it's best to build them from source for the most up-to-date experience.)


### Robrix: an up-and-coming Matrix chat client for power users

We started [Robrix] about one year ago with the intention of it being a "flagship" Robius app â€” one that would help drive the development (and priority) of various Robius components and demonstrate their utility.
Since then, our plans for Robrix have expanded beyond it serving as just a demo app or a basic Matrix client; we discuss our longer-term, multi-stage [vision for Robrix later in this article](#robrix-roadmap-for-2025-and-beyond).

Robrix has come a long way over the past year, thanks to 750+ commits from 10 contributors!
Since starting from scratch, we have created a functional Matrix chat client with most fundamental features already complete and working well, as shown by our feature status tracker below.

![Robrix's feature status tracker](/blog/robrix_feature_status_tracker.png)


With these features in place, we have began dogfooding Robrix as a daily Matrix client!

While not all main features are complete, Robrix *does* already have some cool features that help both power users and casual users be more productive.
The biggest unique feature of Robrix is an "IDE-like" desktop UI that can display multiple rooms side-by-side in separate tabs, which can be docked and moved around via drag-n-drop actions.
No more wasted horizontal space!

![Robrix side-by-side dockable tab UI](/blog/robrix_desktop_ui.png)

Another cool feature is that Robrix's UI can automatically transition to different view layouts based on window size. This enables our single codebase to run seamlessly on desktop and mobile platforms, but you can also use any view on any platform if you want.
For example, we frequently enjoy using the mid-size tablet view (below, left) or the narrow mobile view (below, middle) on a smaller laptop screen too, in addition to on our smartphones (below, right).

<p float="left">
  <img align="middle" alt="Robrix mid-size UI view" src="/blog/robrix_midsize_ui.png" width="43%" />
  <img align="middle" alt="Robrix narrow mobile UI view of the rooms list" src="/blog/robrix_mobile_view_rooms_list.png" width="27.5%" />
  <img align="middle" alt="Robrix narrow mobile UI view on Android of a single room" src="/blog/robrix_android_view_single_room.png" width="25.9%" />
</p>


Beyond a sleek UI, Robrix also leverages multiple Robius crates for deep integration with the native platform:
* `robius-open` to open URLs, images, and downloaded files
* `robius-location` to obtain and share the user's current location in a Matrix room
* `robius-url-handler` to register Robrix as a default handler for the `matrix:` URL scheme (and others)
* `robius-directories` to ensure that we store app data and cached content in the platform-canonical directories
* `robius-keychain` to store a user's login session tokens (this is a WIP)
* `robius-packaging-commands` to help easily build app bundles for desktop platforms using cargo-packager
* In the future, we'll allow users to mark individual rooms as "secret", such that they are hidden behind an authentication prompt provided by `robius-authentication`


* TODO: confirm the below measurements. Add CPU Utilization??

In addition to a sleek UI and robust platform integration, Robrix is highly performant and efficient thanks to its underlying pure-Rust stack and Makepad's emphasis on lightweight, performant code.
Our rough benchmarks show that Robrix can easily achieve over 90 FPS (TODO: measure this) on an older M1 Macbook Pro, even when scrolling through 10+ rooms displayed side-by-side.
Robrix achieves this while using only around 26-30% of the system RAM that major Electron-based Matrix desktop clients consume to display a single room.


Most importantly, thanks to the power of Makepad and Robius, Robrix has zero platform-specific code.
This makes it easy to maintain and develop features/bugfixes quickly, as you don't have to consider the idiosyncracies of each platform.
Thus, we invite you to check out our codebase and contribute any cool missing features that you'd love to have!

### Moly: chat with local LLMs and custom AI agents

[Moly] (f.k.a. *Moxin*) is a pure Rust GUI client for running local Large Language Models (LLMs) and chatting with various AI agents.
You can discover, browse, and download major open-source AI models:
![Moly's discover LLM screen](/blog/moly_discover_screen.png)
and then chat with them *locally* without contacting any hosted LLM service.
![Moly's LLM chat screen](/blog/moly_chat_screen.png)


Like Robrix, Moly was started about one year ago completely from scratch, and has been a significant driver for the development of fundamental Makepad widgets, components, and Robius infrastructure.
For example, Project Robius contributions to Moly and to other projects (at the request of Moly) were driven by these needs:
* Better packaging logic and build configuration, which became [`robius-packaging-commands`].
  * This cooperates with `cargo-packager` to generate Moly app bundles for all 3 major desktop platforms.
* Portable Rust installation & setup "scripts" that run before the GUI app starts, which became [`moly-runner`].
  * This was needed to install and configure the [WasmEdge WASM runtime], which is how Moly runs LLMs locally.
  * This is also useful for setting up the complex WasmEdge + Moly development environment in just one click.
* Many new Makepad widgets: modals, pop-up notifications, sliding panels, draggable sliders, etc.
* Standardized app behaviors to be more platform-compliant and canonical, e.g., proper use of app data directories.



To learn more about Moly, check out [this blog post](https://dev.to/zhanghandong/moly-an-open-source-llm-client-implemented-in-pure-rust-1hmd) that demonstrates more cool features, screenshots, and examples of what you can do with Moly.
Due to constraints from the underlying WasmEdge runtime, Moly currently runs only on major desktop platforms (Linux, macOS, Windows), but support for iOS and Android is planned.



## 3. Select contributions to other Rust app dev projects
In addition to creating, maintaining, and publishing our own crates for Rust app dev, we also strive to contribute to and improve existing crates that are already prominently used in the ecosystem.

* We began using and making contributions to [`cargo-packager`], a packaging solution for Rust apps on Desktop target platforms created and open-sourced by Crab-Nebula, the folks behind the excellent Tauri ecosystem
    * [Our contributions](https://github.com/crabnebula-dev/cargo-packager/pulls?q=author%3Akevinaboos) were mostly minor bugfixes and improvements to allow the packaging infrastructure to be configured more flexibly
    * As previously mentioned, we published [`robius-packaging-commands`], a companion to `cargo-packager` that makes it easier to build & configure complex apps
        * Automatically calculates the set of dependencies for Debian `.deb` packages
        * Automatically handles Makepad configuration and resource/asset discovery & bundling
    * We intend to add support for other Desktop package formats, namely Flatpack
    * We also plan to contribute support for generating mobile app bundles, namely Android


* We have made [myriad major contributions](https://github.com/makepad/makepad/pulls?q=author%3Akevinaboos) to the Makepad UI toolkit, as Robrix and Moly are two of the most complex/demanding apps built in Makepad
    * Improvements to `PortalList`, a virtual viewport list with infinite scrolling
        * Better API with more introspection into the positional & visibility state of items in the list, its scrolling state, and its item caching behavior
        * Efficient implementations of smooth scrolling animations, e.g., jump to bottom or jump to a given item index
        * Redesign how items are stored and indexed, and how visible items are tracked
    * Rich text formatting for displaying both HTML and Markdown content
        * Including support for most formatting-relevant tags: (un)ordered lists, strikethrough/underline, coloring, indentation, blockquote, code, etc.
        * Special handling of interactive components like HTML links, which must preserve external formatting
    * Multiple new widgets: avatar images with text fallback, abstractions over rich (HTML) text and plaintext, modals, sliding panes, etc
    * Make writing event handlers more ergonomic by avoiding mutable borrows when querying views/widgets
    * Redesign of underlying Android platform layer to allow external crates to access Android system states
    * Enable correct discovery of resource/asset files in macOS/iOS app bundles
    * Many improvements to `cargo-makepad`, a build tool to generate mobile app packages
        * Overhaul code to generate Android APKs
        * Properly install/configure the NDK toolchain on all 3 desktop platforms, plus enable building native code (via `cc-rs`)
        * Ensure backwards compatibility with standard Android Studio-managed SDKs
    * An improved app lifecycle model with dedicated events for all lifecycle stages, which is consistent across all platforms
    * Easier and more ergonomic `Actions` (widget-to-widget message events)
        * Plus support for delivering an action to a widget from a background thread or async task context

* [Our contributions](https://github.com/kornelski/rust-security-framework/pull/210) to the [`security-framework`] crate, which offers Rust bindings to Apple's security framework (for TLS, keychain, etc)
    * We added a few missing APIs to enabling updating or deleting keychain items, which we needed to fully implement [`robius-keychain`]

* We implemented a Rust auto-installer and configurer for the [WasmEdge WASM runtime], as mentioned [above](#moly-chat-with-local-llms-and-custom-ai-agents)
    * This massively simplifies both the developer-side build process and the user installation procedure for Moly, which relies on WasmEdge to run LLMs locally.
    * We hope to transform this into the official install script for WasmEdge and upstream it for general usage there, as much of the effort involved was devoted to extracting the precise system configuration required to select and install the proper WasmEdge release.


## 4. Cross-collaboration with other UI and App Dev orgs
Beyond publishing crates and developing apps, we also want to bring together people of all stripes across the Ruist UI and App Dev ecosystem.
To that end, Project Robius hosted an [App Dev unconference](https://2024.rustnl.org/unconf/) at RustNL 2024 (and also GOSIM Beijing 2024), in which a few dozen Rust developers from across the world met up to discuss the shared problems we all face in developing Rust apps and UI toolkits.
We discussed everything from build tooling to text layout, accessibility, Winit compatibility, and more.
A few of the topics & ideas from the unconference(s) have already made it past the discussion phase and have become real projects!
* [`kittest`]: a universal UI testing framework built upon the AccessKit accessibility framework, spearheaded by the eGUI team!
* [Dioxus's work on hotreloading](https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/1ezdjqx/media_i_added_instant_hotreloading_of_some_rust/) not just UI DSL code, but even real Rust code that implements app behavior!
* Feedback given to the Rust project teams, primarily lang, libs, and compiler.
    * We focused on changes to Rust that will make future Rust apps easier to write, with simplified and more ergonomic code patterns for async and more.

In addition, thanks to our colleague Sid Askary, we began monthly meet-ups to chat about ongoing Rust UI & App Dev concerns, and to share ideas, solutions, progress updates.
Attendees vary, but often include teammembers from [Robius](https://robius.rs/), [Makepad](https://makepad.nl/), the [Linebender organization](https://linebender.org/) (behind Xilem and more), [Dioxus](https://dioxuslabs.com/), [eGUI](https://github.com/emilk/egui), [Pax](https://www.pax.dev/), [wgpu](https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu), [Slint](https://slint.dev/), and more.
If you're in the Rust App Dev or UI space and would like to join future meetups, consider getting in touch!



## Project Robius Roadmap for 2025

Project Robius in 2025 aims to continue the work we've begun in 2024 to improve the overall app dev experience in Rust.

#### More Rust abstractions for platform features
As a technical organization, our primary ongoing focus will be to keep creating and publishing as many high-quality platform feature abstraction crates as possible.
Our targeted platform features include (in rough priority order):
* File/image/media picker (in progress)
* Native system notifications (in progress)
* Toasts, pop-up messages, status bar icons
    * We have implemented this in Makepad, but not with native widgets commonly used on Mobile platforms
* Spawning long-running background tasks/services
* System file/media store
* Native context menus
    * Same status as toasts above.
* Camera access & configuration
* Audio input (microphone)
* System theming choices (e.g., dark mode, key colors)
* Connectivity manager/subscriber
* Power/battery status
* Haptics/vibration


#### Better, more automated build tooling
Another topic dear to our hearts is build tooling.
We aim to improve the state of build tools such that the app developer themself can be relieved from the burden of managing and figuring out platform-specific details, such as which permissions/entitlements their app requires to build and run properly on mobile platforms.
Ideally, we'd like to be able to auto-generate a fully-formed Android XML manifest or Apple `Info.plist` file with all of the necessary permissions that an app requires, without requiring the app dev to possess expert knowledge about the requirements of their app's dependencies and transitive dependencies.

One such idea for realizing this is have each `robius-*` platform feature abstraction crate automatically emit its required permissions during the build process.
Exactly *how* to export and encode this information is still up in the air, but we have discussed leveraging a linker-based approach similar to what [Dioxus's manganis project](https://github.com/DioxusLabs/manganis) does to encode resource/asset paths into special linker sections.
This would allow a top-level tool to run after the `cargo build` process, and inspect the binary's special linker sections in order to automatically generate a full permissions/entitlements file for the given target platform.
We envision that this could also be used for other arbitrary UI toolkits, not just Makepad, as well as emitted by other platform abstraction crates outside of the `robius-*` organization.

 <!-- that deeply nested crates in the dependency graph have, e.g., location permissions. For this, we can mention Dioxus's approach towards resource management by leveraging special linker sections, which we can also leverage for enumerating and specifying required permissions in a standardized way.  -->




#### Effortless integration with other UI toolkits
In addition, we wish to explore deeper integration and first-class compatibility (and testing pipelines) with other Rust UI toolkits, e.g., Dioxus, eGUI, and more.
Our first year of development has been centered on Makepad, in the sense that we've built two full-size Makepad apps, contributed significantly to Makepad itself, and have focused on test-driving our crates using Makepad apps (see [`robius-demo-simple`]).
Thus, using Robius components in a Makepad app is quite easy for the app developer.

Now that we have successfully realized several platform feature abstraction crates, we would like to ensure that these can be easily utilized by apps built in other UI toolkits.
For example, one specific secondary goal for this year is to explore how `robius-*` crates could comprise Dioxus's [`dioxus-std`] library and fill in the gaps in their mobile platform support.


Another related goal is to design a UI-focused concurrency management library with an interface that helps app devs easily write high-performance apps that never block or bog down the main UI thread with long-running operations.
We envision easy interfaces to offload code to background threads or async tasks, as well as for exchanging data between these background contexts and the performance-sensitive the UI main thread.
The inability to easily invoke async functions from the UI main thread (without causing performance hiccups) is a long-running frustration we have had when developing Robrix, as many SDKs are written with a hard dependency on an async executor, typically tokio.


> To understand this concurrency challenge in more detail, [watch this presentation on Robrix (starting from 23:10)](https://youtu.be/DO5C7aITVyU?si=N_10UZBCR5g-w2D4&t=1390) or [check out slides 26-33 here](https://github.com/project-robius/files/blob/main/GOSIM%20China%202024/Robrix%20Talk%20GOSIM%20China%20October%2017%2C%202024.pdf).


A key component of this is an abstraction for a *compile-time token* that statically ensures whether code is executing within the context of the main UI thread context.
Such a type must be both non-`Send` and non-`Sync`, and only possible to construct on the main UI thread.
This token is necessary because most platforms require many of their platform-provided APIs to be invoked on the main thread, and it's significantly better to check this at compile time than via a runtime assertion.
We have realized this for Makepad via a mutable reference to the [context type](https://github.com/makepad/makepad/blob/0084948c176a99740af92a71578543c3fcc0b63f/platform/src/cx.rs#L55) `&mut Cx`, which is created only on the main UI thread and then passed as a mutable reference to all of the [event handlers and draw routines](https://github.com/makepad/makepad/blob/0084948c176a99740af92a71578543c3fcc0b63f/widgets/src/widget.rs#L45-L110).


While this sort of concurrency library and statically-determinable thread context abstraction is highly desirable, it is also admittedly a longer-term goal that merits major effort beyond just 2025.


#### Organizing more conferences & meet-ups
On the organizational side, we intend to sponsor two more conferences for open-source Rust development and host informal Rust app dev unconferences co-located with those conferences.
The first will be [RustWeek 2025](https://rustweek.org/) (formerly "RustNL") in the Netherlands in May, and the second will be [GOSIM China](https://china2024.gosim.org/) in autumn 2025.
With these (un)conferences, we aim to bring community members together again to collaborate, share ideas, and further advance the state-of-the-art for App Dev and UI in Rust.



## Robrix Roadmap for 2025 and beyond

While Robrix is off to a strong start, we still have a long way to go.
We have planned several high-level phases of Robrix development over the next 18-24 months:
1. Release an alpha version of Robrix with most fundamental Matrix features available.
    * Realize sufficient functionality to be usable as a daily driver, but not yet to be a complete replacement for existing clients.
    * This is nearly complete! See [Milestone 1](https://github.com/project-robius/robrix/milestone/1) on our GitHub page.
2. Publish Robrix v1.0 with full Matrix functionality, for "power" users.
    * Offer a responsive UI design with a dockable, multi-tab view of many rooms side-by-side, which also adapts to varying screen sizes (mobile, desktop, etc).
        * âœ… This is already complete! ([as described above](#robrix-an-up-and-coming-matrix-chat-client-for-power-users))
    * Achieve feature parity with existing major clients, including administrative features like a full settings pane, session management, room creation/admin, message search, threads, spaces, etc.
        * See [Milestone 2](https://github.com/project-robius/robrix/milestone/2) on our GitHub page for more details.
        * Generally, these features are *not* drivers of Robius development, as they don't require complex platform features, so they were initially lower priority.
    * Distribute Robrix app bundles to platform app stores and package managers.
3. Integrate local LLM runtimes (like [Moly](#moly-chat-with-local-llms-and-custom-ai-agents)) for powerful, advanced convenience features.
    * LLMs or AI agents can summarize conversations, analyze important topics, and extract key action items from "what you missed" after a holiday.
        > Here's an example UI prototype:
        >
        > <img alt="A prototype UI design for AI LLMs alongside Matrix rooms in Robrix" src="/blog/robrix_moly_prototype.png" width="45%" />
    * AI chatbots can assist newcomers in large open-source projects by auto-answering FAQs, either privately or publicly to allow for additional interaction from real expert users.
    * Key point: *fully-local* LLM runtimes **cannot jeopardize end-to-end encrypted (E2EE) rooms or user data sovereignty**.
4. Go beyond Matrix: Robrix as a central "hub" for federated & open-source services
    * Collect multiple services into a unified app view, including ActivityPub-based microblogs (e.g., [Mastodon]), views of source code and related issues/pull requests, discussion forums (e.g., [Lemmy]), and more.
        * The exact set of supported services are TBD.
    * The availability of many services in a single app context can enable unique combo features, such as a combined activity feed of notifications + news from various sources, or easy one-click broadcasting of project updates to multiple communities across different services.


5. *[Long-term]* Explore how to use decentralized identity providers like [OpenWallet] to login to Robrix-supported services.
    * Use Robrix as the first experimental testing ground for integrating a device-local wallet app as an ID provider for Matrix authentication.
    * For more info, check out [this presentation by Wenjing Chu, an OpenWallet expert](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eq9pnYB5-Xk) from the Matrix Conference 2024.


While many of these are larger endeavors, we anticipate being able to complete at least milestones 1, 2, and 3 by the end of this coming year.
